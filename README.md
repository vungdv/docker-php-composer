### Overview
This repository contains a Docker image with PHP and the Composer package manager.

**The image is meant to be used as the parent image for your Dockerfile in your PHP Composer project.** Use it with the `FROM` instruction in your Dockerfile and build your image on top of it. 

This image uses the latest version of Composer. You can find the details about Composer installation in `composer-install.sh`.Composer installation is based on this description: 
[https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md).

## Usage
This image has Composer installed and available as a global command called `composer`. You can use it in your Dockerfile to install your PHP packages described in your `composer.json` file.

### Dockerfile example
You can create a Dockerfile based on this image and use it in your project, here is an example: 
```
FROM vungdv/php-composer.json:7.2.2.2-apache

COPY ./composer.json /var/www/html/
RUN composer install $$ \
    rm -rf /var/www/html/composer-cache
COPY ./public /var/www/html/public
```

### `composer.json` example

Please make sure to specify a composer cache location. The above Dockerfile assumes that your composer cache is located in your working directory and is called `composer-cache`. You can clean up your composer cache location as shown in the Dockerfile example above. 

The bellow sample `composer.json` shows how to specify the `cache-dir` and has some sample Slim packages. 
```
{
    "config":{
        "cache-dir": "/var/www/html/composer=cache"
    },
    "require": {
        "slim/slim": "^3.0"
    }
}
```
The Dockerfile has ONBUILD triggers to copy `composer.json` and the `public` directory from your project into the image.

Once `composer.json` is copied into the image composer install is triggered with ONBUILD
